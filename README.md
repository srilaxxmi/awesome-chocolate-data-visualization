# Awesome Chocolate Data Visualization

## Portofolio Project
This portfolio was created as a homework assignment using a simple business question. The learning source I used to study data visualization is Chandoo's YouTube channel, and I am using the same dataset as him.

## Data Source
Awesome Chocolates Dataset is collected from: https://chandoo.org/wp/

## Data Cleaning
1. Data loading into Microsoft Power BI
2. Replacing null data
3. Trim unnecessary spaces

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Which chocolate product sold the most?
2. Most sales by country
3. Sales trend and customer trend for a year
